# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraud detection is a critical task in financial services where the goal is to minimize false negatives (frauds that go undetected) while also keeping false positives low.
We use the Credit Card Fraud dataset, preprocess and normalize the data, handle class imbalance with resampling techniques, and train multiple classification models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest). <br/>

ðŸš€ Features

Data preprocessing & normalization<br/>
Handling class imbalance using SMOTE<br/>
Training models: Logistic Regression & Random Forest<br/>
Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score & Confusion Matrix<br/>
Feature importance visualization<br/>

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which contains:<br/>
Transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.<br/>
284,807 transactions in total.<br/>
Only 492 frauds (0.172%), making it highly imbalanced.<br/>
